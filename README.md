#### This is a example of how to create your own dataset and Face Recognition Model without using any pre trained model.
###### For creating dataset you have to capture picture of person or you can scrape images from internet using one of my project on data scraping. You can clone data scraping project from here https://github.com/iamatulsingh/pinterest-image-scrap.git
