#### This is a example of how to create your own dataset and Face Recognition Model without using any pre trained model.
###### For creating dataset, you have to capture picture of a person or you can scrape images from internet using one of my project on data scraping. You can clone data scraping project from here https://github.com/iamatulsingh/pinterest-image-scrap.git
